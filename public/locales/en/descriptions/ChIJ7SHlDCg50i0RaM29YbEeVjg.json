    { "title": "Concept & Ambiance", "body": "Penny Lane's primary identity is that of a visual destination, consistently described as \"Instagrammable\" and \"stunning.\" Its decor is a bold fusion of \"bohemian chic\" and \"Moroccan\" styles, with a high glass ceiling creating a greenhouse feel, filled with lush greenery and eclectic art. However, its immense popularity creates an atmospheric conflict; long wait times during peak hours can make it feel more like a photo studio than a relaxing restaurant." },
    { "title": "Menu & Signature Experience", "body": "The core conflict at Penny Lane is the vast divide between the praised ambiance and the polarized food reviews. On one hand, there is near-universal praise for the environment, and on the other, divided opinions on the food. The drinks are a highlight, especially the frequently recommended Kim Karpassion cocktail. However, many reviews describe the food as a \"huge disappointment\" and \"bland,\" although dishes like the Loaded Fries and Schnitzel have received some positive mentions." },
    { "title": "Conclusion", "body": "Penny Lane is a masterpiece of the \"experience economy,\" where the main product is not the food but the immersive experience and the resulting social capital (i.e., Instagram photos). Its business model successfully leverages its stunning aesthetics to ensure constant foot traffic, despite significant culinary shortcomings. It represents a polarized but undeniable archetype in modern tourism: the destination as a backdrop, forcing visitors to choose between aesthetics and appetite." }
