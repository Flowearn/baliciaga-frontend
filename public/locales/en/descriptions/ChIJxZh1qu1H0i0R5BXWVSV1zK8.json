    { "title": "Concept & Ambiance", "body": "The Shady Pig is a narrative-driven, immersive speakeasy bar. Its core concept is rooted in the \"rebellious spirit of 1920s Birmingham\" (inspired by Peaky Blinders). The experience is highly theatrical, from the secret entrance behind a bookcase to the nightly password obtained via Instagram DM, with every step creating a unique sense of exclusivity and mystery." },
    { "title": "Menu & Signature Experience", "body": "This is a temple to the art of the cocktail. The menu is crafted by an \"experimental\" bartending team using advanced techniques like distillation, barrel-aging, and clarification. The menu is curated into themes to guide guests. Signature cocktails include the Banana Walnut Old Fashioned, a creative twist on a classic, and the technically superb, clarified Flavors of Bali." },
