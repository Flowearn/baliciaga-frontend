Its core concept is all-day versatility: an \"Australian-style breakfast\" and specialty coffee spot by day, which transforms to serve \"housemade pasta and steaks\" by night. Its \"industrial-chic\" ambiance, spacious two-floor venue, and ample power outlets with fast Wi-Fi have made it a favorite for digital nomads." },

The day menu features specialty coffee and pastries, while the evening brings heartier fare like the popular Beef Ragu Pappardelle. The vibe is further enhanced by live music four nights a week, making it the \"perfect way to spend a balmy evening in Bali.\"" },
