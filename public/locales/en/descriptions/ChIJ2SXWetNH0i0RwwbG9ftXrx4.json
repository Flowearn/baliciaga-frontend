    { "title": "Concept & Ambiance", "body": "SKOOL Kitchen is a powerful, multi-sensory dining destination with a concept forged around a single, primal element: fire. It's an \"open-fire kitchen\" where every dish is touched by flames for a signature smoky flavor. This concept, combined with its prime location above The Lawn beach club and its unbeatable ocean views, creates an immersive atmosphere of \"crackling flames and ocean waves.\"" },
    { "title": "Menu & Signature Experience", "body": "The menu focuses on \"Grill\" and \"Seafood,\" defined by pure, bold, smoky flavors. Signature must-haves include the Argentinian Red Prawns, described as a \"flavor bomb,\" the smoky Grilled Lamb, and the delicate Hay-smoked Kingfish Tartare. A key strategy is elevating side dishes like the Potato Gratin to \"hero\" status, which earns immense praise." },
