    { "title": "Concept & Ambiance", "body": "Cinta Pererenan's core concept is \"Love\" (Cinta), which the restaurant considers the \"main ingredient\" in all its dishesâ€”a guiding principle, not just a marketing slogan. Located in the quieter Pererenan area, its ambiance blends \"modern design with Balinese flair\" and a \"European touch.\" The thoughtfully designed space, with both air-conditioned indoor and breezy outdoor areas, features a \"tranquil corner\" with rice field views, creating a serene and elegant feeling perfect for romantic dinners or friendly gatherings." },
    { "title": "Menu & Signature Experience", "body": "Cinta's menu is a modern interpretation of Balinese and international cuisine, with a firm commitment to fresh, locally sourced organic ingredients and a \"from scratch\" cooking philosophy.

    { "title": "Conclusion", "body": "Cinta Pererenan is a model of harmonious concept and execution.
