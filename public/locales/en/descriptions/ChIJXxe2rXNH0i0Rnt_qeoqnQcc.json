    { "title": "Concept & Ambiance", "body": "Uma Garden's philosophy is both profound and simple: \"bringing people together around real food and good vibes.\" Nestled in the quiet outskirts of Umalas, its identity is forged in the elemental power of \"fire-based cooking.\" The entire restaurant is a lush tropical garden with communal tables to encourage sharing, while the open-flame kitchen serves as a central stage, turning cooking into a captivating performance." },
    { "title": "Menu & Signature Experience", "body": "The menu is an array of \"flame-kissed dishes.\" Premium meats like the Australian Wagyu Tomahawk are featured. However, the kitchen's finesse is equally shown in other dishes: the Lamb Stifado (slow-cooked lamb) is consistently recommended as a must-try, and the Grilled Scallops with Nduja butter are also a crowd-favorite." },
    { "title": "Conclusion", "body": "Uma Garden offers a dining experience that is simultaneously rustic and elevated. It successfully delivers on its promise of \"elemental cooking,\" creating an enchanting atmosphere that celebrates community, simplicity, and the pure flavor of fire-kissed ingredients. It is a true \"flavor-forward escape\" in Umalas for those seeking a unique and authentic meal." }
