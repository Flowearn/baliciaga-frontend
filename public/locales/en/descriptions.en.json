        "title": "Guiding Philosophy",
        "body": "PUCO aims to be a \"contemporary breakthrough in the #worklifebalance movement\" by applying the Balinese philosophy of Tri Hita Karana. This philosophy emphasizes balance and harmony among people (Pawongan), with the environment (Palemahan), and with God (Parhyangan). However, a critical question arises: how is this profound local philosophy actually embodied in PUCO's daily operations? PUCO explicitly claims this philosophy, but its offerings—hourly rates, a restaurant, meeting rooms—seem functionally similar to other coworking spaces. This raises the question of whether the philosophy is a core value deeply integrated into its operations (e.g., through community initiatives, environmental practices, cultural workshops) or if it is used more as a unique branding element. For users seeking an authentic cultural experience, this is a key point to consider."

This caters to a wide range of needs, from the casual user needing a few hours to a full-time member.\n\nIntegrated Eatery: The in-house restaurant is a core feature, and members receive a discount."

It also has a pet-friendly rooftop terrace.\n\nCapacity: The 22-person communal table, plus private offices and other seating, indicates a medium-sized capacity.\n\nVibe & Bustle: Reviews suggest the atmosphere is productive and less crowded, especially on Fridays. The view is a major highlight. However, one review noted that phone calls must be taken on the terrace, but the WiFi doesn't work there—a significant flaw."

However, the reported issue with terrace WiFi is a serious concern for anyone who needs to make frequent calls. The \"Tri Hita Karana\" philosophy remains an open question, representing either a deep cultural commitment or a missed opportunity for differentiation."
